## What is the lifecycle of PIP?

The following is the standardization process for all Push Protocol Standards Improvement Proposals:

![Proposal Process](/assets/template/pip_lifecycle.png)

**Idea** - An idea that is pre-draft. It can be done over Push [Discord](https://discord.gg/Ftv83Dgw) or [Push forum](https://gov.epns.io/c/general-discussions/18) .

**Draft** - The first formally tracked stage of a proposal in development. To create draft, you should submit PR request against an issue in
`epns-protocol-standards` repository. Make sure the draft should be in the respective payload standards subdirectory.

**Last Call** - This is the final review window for a PIP before moving to Final. A PIP editor will assign Last Call status and set a review end date (last-call-deadline), typically 14 days later.

If this period results in necessary normative changes, it will revert the PIP to Review.

**Review** - An Author marks a proposal as ready for and requests Peer Review. This is the final window for the proposal before moving to the final.

**Final** - This represents the final standard. A Final proposal exists in a state of finality and should only be updated to correct errata and add non-normative clarifications.

**Stagnant** - Any proposal in Draft or Review or Last Call if inactive for a period of 4 months or greater, is moved to Stale. The proposal may be resurrected from this state by Authors or  Editors by moving it back to Draft or it's earlier status. If not resurrected, a proposal may stay forever in this status.

**Withdrawn** - The  Author(s) have withdrawn the proposed submission. This state has finality and can no longer be resurrected using this proposal number. If the idea is pursued at a later date it is considered a new proposal.

**Living** - A special status for PIPs that are designed to be continually updated and not reach a state of finality. This includes most notably PIP-1.
